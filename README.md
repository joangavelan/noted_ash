## Prerequisites

Before setting up the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Elixir**: Version 1.14 or later. [Installation Guide](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)
- **Erlang**: Version 24 or later. [Installation Guide](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)
- **Node.js**: Version 16 or later. [Installation Guide](https://nodejs.org/)
- **PostgreSQL**: Ensure it's installed and running. [Installation Guide](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

## Setup Instructions

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joangavelan/noted_ash.git
cd noted_ash
```

### Install Dependencies

Fetch and install the necessary Elixir dependencies:

```bash
mix deps.get
```

Install Node.js dependencies for the frontend:

```bash
cd assets
npm install
cd ..
```

### Configure Environment Variables

The application requires environment variables for Google OAuth2 authentication. Create a file named `.env` in the project root and add the following variables:

```bash
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
export GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=your_google_redirect_uri
```

Replace `your_google_client_id` and `your_google_client_secret` with your actual Google OAuth2 credentials, and `your_google_redirect_uri` with your application's redirect URI.

**Note:** The `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` should match the redirect URI configured in your Google Console OAuth2 settings.

### Database Configuration

Configure your database settings in `config/dev.exs`. Ensure the `username`, `password`, `hostname`, and `database` fields match your PostgreSQL setup:

```elixir
config :noted, Noted.Repo,
  username: "your_db_username",
  password: "your_db_password",
  hostname: "localhost",
  database: "noted_dev",
```

### Create and Migrate the Database

Set up the database by running:

```bash
mix ecto.create
mix ecto.migrate
```

### Start the Server

Start the Phoenix server while loading the `.env` file:

```bash
source .env && mix phx.server
```

The `source .env` command ensures your environment variables are loaded, and `mix phx.server` starts the application. The app will be accessible at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
